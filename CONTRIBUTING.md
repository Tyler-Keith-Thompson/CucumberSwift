### Contributing

Let's keep this short and sweet. So you want to contribute to CucumberSwift? Cool! There are 3 things required to do so:

- Be available for questions. If there's confusion about what you wrote or why you wrote it that way we need to be able to talk about it before it makes it into main.
- TEST YOUR CODE! CucumberSwift is primarily black-box tested, that's fine. Feel free to unit test as well, the point is the testing framework really ought to be tested.
- Submit a Pull Request. At this point you've got everything tested, your new feature or bug fix is in place and you know you'll be near your email for the next few days. Submit your PR and we'll get it turned around and into main ASAP


I realize this document is somewhat lacking in terms of process, for now I don't care. If we start seeing more contributors I'll think through more how this should work.
